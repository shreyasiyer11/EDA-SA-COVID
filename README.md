# EDA-SA-COVID

In this notebook, we use the South African COVID-19 Vulnerability dataset and perform Explorartory Data Analysis (EDA) for large households who must leave their homes to fetch water - using 2011 South African census data. These households will be identified as vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic and targeted for special government assistance.
